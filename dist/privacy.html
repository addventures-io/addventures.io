                  AddVentures. The
                  use of the Internet pages of AddVentures is possible without any indication of personal data; however,
                  if a
                  data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data
                  could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory
                  basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject. The processing of
                  personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall
                  always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
                  country-specific data protection regulations applicable to AddVentures. By means of this data protection
                  declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
                  of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of
                  this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
                  As the controller, AddVentures has implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to
                  ensure the
                  most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
                  transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For
                  this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
                  telephone.

                <p class="gr-text-9">The data protection declaration of AddVentures is based on the terms used by the European
                  legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
                  declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and
                  business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
                  In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">a) Personal Data</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
                  natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly
                  or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
                  location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
                  genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">b) Data subject</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data
                  is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">c) Processing</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
                  data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
                  organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure
                  by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction,
                  erasure or destruction.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">d) Restriction of processing</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of
                  limiting their processing in the future.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">e) Profiling</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the
                  use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular
                  to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic
                  situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">f) Pseudonymisation</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the
                  personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
                  information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical
                  and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
                  identifiable natural person.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal
                  person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                  purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
                  are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
                  nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">h) Processor</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
                  which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">i) Recipient</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body,
                  to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities
                  which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or
                  Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public
                  authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes
                  of the processing.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">j) Third party</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other
                  than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
                  controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
                </p>
                <h3 class="gr-text-9">k) Consent</h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous
                  indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative
                  action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

                <p class="gr-text-9">The website of AddVentures collects a series of general data and information when a data
                  subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the
                  server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system
                  used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website
                  (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6)
                  an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system,
                  and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our
                  information technology systems.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">When using these general data and information, AddVentures does not draw any conclusions
                  about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
                  correctly, (2) optimise the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the
                  long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law
                  enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a
                  cyber-attack. Therefore, AddVentures analyses anonymously collected data and information statistically, with
                  the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
                  optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log
                  files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

                <p class="gr-text-9">On the website of AddVentures, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our
                  enterprise's newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are
                  transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">AddVentures informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter
                  about enterprise offers. The enterprise's newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1)
                  the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter
                  shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for
                  the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This
                  confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is
                  authorised to receive the newsletter.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the
                  computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the
                  time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this
                  data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject
                  at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only
                  be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail,
                  as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in
                  question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the
                  event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by
                  the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the
                  data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has
                  given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of
                  consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the
                  newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the
                  controller in a different way.

                <p class="gr-text-9">The newsletter of AddVentures contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a
                  miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording
                  and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing
                  campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, AddVentures may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a
                  data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters
                  are stored and analysed by the controller in order to optimise the shipping of the newsletter, as well
                  as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These
                  personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke
                  the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a
                  revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. AddVentures automatically regards a
                  withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.

                  so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via
                  a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such
                  personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for
                  the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data

                </h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics
                  (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the
                  collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behaviour of visitors to websites. A web
                  analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the
                  so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was
                  viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimisation of a website and in order to carry out a
                  cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre
                  Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.
                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application
                  "_gat. _anonymizeIp". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the
                  data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of
                  the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
                  The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the traffic on our website. Google uses
                  the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide
                  online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning
                  the use of our Internet site for us.


                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data
                  subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is
                  enabled to analyse the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this
                  Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was
                  integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will
                  automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising
                  and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the
                  enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject,
                  which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently
                  create commission settlements.

                <p class="gr-text-9">The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the
                  location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data
                  subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the
                  Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of
                  America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass
                  these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties. <br>
                  The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time
                  by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting
                  of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from
                  setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies
                  already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software
                  programs.


                </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of
                  data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as
                  the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data
                  subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and
                  install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and
                  information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The
                  installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information
                  technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data
                  subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was
                  uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence,
                  or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.

                  Medium doesn’t make money from ads. So they don’t collect data in order to advertise to you. The
                  tracking Medium does is to make their product work as well as possible.

                <p class="gr-text-9">On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter. Twitter is a
                  multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service on which users may publish and spread
                  so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short messages, which are limited to 280 characters. These short messages are
                  available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter. The tweets are also
                  displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow
                  a user's tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or
                  retweets.

                  Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to
                  download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. During the course of this
                  technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by
                  the data subject. The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the

                  increase our visitor numbers.

                  information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with the respective Twitter
                  account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on

                </h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which
                  we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary
                  for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example,
                  when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
                  processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which
                  are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
                  concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing
                  of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based
                  on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect
                  the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for
                  example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other
                  vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the
                  processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on
                  Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by
                  any of the above-mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                  legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are
                  overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                  protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have
                  been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could
                  be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

                <p class="gr-text-9">The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the
                  respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is

                </h3>
                <p class="gr-text-9">We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax
                  regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual
                  partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with
                  personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged
                  to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision
                  of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be
                  concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any
                  employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is
                  required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
                  obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
